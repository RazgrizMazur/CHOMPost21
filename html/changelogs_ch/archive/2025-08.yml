  - bugfix: loadout system not working until you switch back and forth
  - code_imp: weak_reference added to blacklisted copyvars
  FluffMedic:
  - balance: The doorway bosses to base Neon have a bit less HP.
  - bugfix: Tyr ants stop infighting
  - bugfix: The Tyr precursor bosses first and second attacks function properly now
  ShadowLarkens:
  - balance: Completely rewrote R&D to be made up of "techweb nodes" that you research
      with experiments + passive point generation. This turns it from a question of
      how to max all levels as fast as possible, to figuring out what paths you want
      to go down and unlock with a time gate.

  CHOMPStation2StaffMirrorBot:
  - qol: Added the ability to use "Transfer Liquids (Vore)" with prey inside of your
      bellies.
  - rscadd: Added ethanol as an option for liquid belly reagents.
  - qol: Zorren now have the option to switch between light furred and dark furred
      base sprites using "Custom Species Icon" in character setup. The now default
      light furred sprite is very lightly shaded and mostly white, allowing it to
      be easily customised for light coloured characters. The dark furred zorren option
      is same as the old base sprite for those that want to preserve their original
      sprites and shading. Thank you to tt2 for helping get this to work.
  - bugfix: Fixed medical issues not proccing for species that can't be infected.
  - bugfix: Fixed medical issues so that they can be cured by ingested reagents too.
  - bugfix: admin ticket replies not being relayed to the chat
  - code_imp: tgui-core 5.0.0
  Kashargul:
  - qol: Chem Synthesizer allows up to 240 characters and 20 steps to make up for
      some more inhibitor changes on chems
  Will:
  - rscadd: Reagent refinery machines
  - rscadd: Gas cracks for fracking that should be made into pois for caves. Deep
      drills make them produce gas, fluid pumps get reagents.
  - rscadd: Re-enabled old ores for future use with the refinery
  - rscadd: '''Metallic'' shades of paint using titanium dioxide'
  - rscadd: distillation reactions for making ink, to turn into paint
  - rscadd: various distillation reactions for reagents previously inaccessible, or
      only obtainable through other means
  - rscadd: various "condensing" distillation reactions that turn atmo gas into reagents
      using coolant
  - refactor: Distillation reactions are now required to be done under specific atmospheres.
      The original distillation reactions can be done under normal atmosphere.
  - bugfix: add missing fluid pump research
  - code_imp: Extended unit-test for reagents to respect new distillation

      fine. Upgrading the turrets is also now more worthwhile!

  - bugfix: fixes a bug where turrets could not be adjusted if they were in an unpowered
      area

  - bugfix: "ensured the honey_extractor can\u2019t run when the maintenance panel\
      \ is open."
  - bugfix: "honey_extractor can now lose power and can\u2019t run when so."
  - qol: 'honey_extractor will now use power 5*200watts for processing 1 honey_frame.

      (can be easily changed if needed)'
  - rscadd: appropriorate messages for the new states.
  - rscadd: appropriorate icons and overlays for the new states.
  - rscadd: Added a new plane for event use, with the intent of making it so that
      only specific players can see things on it.
  - rscadd: Added two new buttons to player effects, one to make something move to  the
      new invisible plane and another to allow a player to see things on that plane.
  - rscadd: Added a new mob that takes advantage of this new plane to be only visible
      to one player at a time.

  - balance: Cells now spawn empty
  - rscadd: Sheetsnatchers now dump happily into material storages
  Diana:
  - bugfix: you will no longer have to beat the snot out of a limb you want to fix
      internal bleeding on with bicard or myelamine
